# Slotify

The project is to streamline the class booking process and maximize the booking utilization. 

Consider this situation where the class scheduling is done via messaging: Student A books a class at 3 pm tomorrow and then Student B would like to have class as well and can only do 3 pm tomorrow. Then the coach askes A if they can pick a different time and A does have other availbility. They both have class, but it comes at a cost of communication. This is what the project is solving.

The project contains 3 parts, two frontends, one for the coaches, one for the students, and a backend.

This repository contains the microservices‚Äêbased implementation.

Other repos:
* [Monolithic-based implementation](https://github.com/XiyuanTu/slotify_backend_monolithic)
* [Frontend for Students](https://github.com/Slotify-txy/frontend_student)
* [Frontend for Coaches](https://github.com/Slotify-txy/frontend_coach)

## Features
* Students can submit availbility by selecting time slots and confirm/reject/accept/cancel appointments.
* Coaches can publish open hours, schedule classes based on students' availbility, and confirm/reject/accept/cancel appointments. 
* The auto scheduling feature will let coaches schedule as many as classes as possible.
* Email notification for open hour and slot status update, with action buttons for accept/confirm/reject/cancel and calendar invites
